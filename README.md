# Face Detection Using YOLOv5
This project was developed and implemented by Daffa Afia Rizfazka and Virdi Rizky Elnanda as part of fulfilling the requirements for the Tugas Besar (Final Project) in the Visi Komputer course.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a robust face detection system utilizing the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once, version 5) architecture. The system is trained and evaluated on the Face Detection Small dataset from Kaggle, which contains annotated images with variations in face orientation, scale, and lighting conditions. The project focuses on achieving high precision and recall metrics, ensuring reliable face detection across diverse scenarios.

## Key Features
- Model Architecture: Utilizes YOLOv5 for real-time object detection with pre-trained weights (yolov5s.pt) for faster convergence and better accuracy.
- Dataset: Trained and tested using the curated Face Detection Small dataset from Kaggle (Link).
- Performance Metrics: Evaluated using precision, recall, and mAP (mean Average Precision) to ensure robust performance across various IoU thresholds.
- Augmentation: Incorporates advanced augmentation techniques (flipping, scaling, mosaic augmentation) to improve model robustness.
- Training Pipeline: Includes early stopping mechanisms and hyperparameter optimization for optimal results.
